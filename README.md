# Garbage-collection-by-ants

This is a simulation of garbage collection by ants. It is based on the simulation in teh book "Turtles, Termites and Traffic Jams" by Mitchel Resnick. Assume there are tiny piecces of garbage scattered in 2-D space, where many ants are wandering randomly. When an ant comes to a place where there is some garbage, it behaves according to very simple behaviour rules:  
1. If the ant is holding a piece of garbage, it drops the piece. 
2. If the ant isn't holding any piece of garbage, it picks up the piece of garbage.    
These simple behavioural rules allow ants to spontaneously collect and pile up garbage and clear up the space in the long run. Such emergent behaviour is counter to our natural intuition that garbage would be scattered more and more due to these insects.
